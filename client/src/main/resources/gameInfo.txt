Are you ready to play Risk? We hope so!
In this game, you will own several territories and battle with your fellow players
to be the last one standing.
The game will proceed as below:

	(1) Each player will select a name (among the available names).
	(2) Each player will place their initial units among their territories.
	(3) The game will then proceed in turns, until only one player is remaining.

The rules of the game are as follows. Each player gets the same number of units to 
place across the territories they own. You may place your units across your territory
however you wish, as long as every placement is a non-negative integer and all placements
add up to the total allowed number. After placing units, the turns will begin. During your
turn you may commit as many actions as you desire. There are two types of actions: (1) Move
and (2) Attack. In a move, you can move units between your territories as long as you own
both territories, you have the units available to move, and there is a valid path of
territories that you own between the two territories. In an attack, you can attack an adjacent
territory from your own territory, using units in your territory. Once all players have
committed all their moves, the turn occurs. The actions are resolved in the following manner:

	(1) All moves occur simultaneously, before attacks.
	(2) All attacks also occur simultaneously.
	(3) All units attacking do not participate in defense.
	(4) For an attack, a 20-sided dice is rolled for each unit to determine who wins.
	(5) The player with units remaining controls the territory.

A player loses when she owns no territories. The turns will proceed until only one player
remains.
